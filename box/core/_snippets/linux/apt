apt-cache rdepends package-name(s) #  Outputs a list of packages that depend upon the specified package. This list can often be rather long, so it is best to pipe its output through a command, like less.
apt-cache pkgnames                 #  Generates a list of the currently installed packages on your system. This list is often rather long, so it is best to pipe its output through a program, like less, or direct the output to a text file.
